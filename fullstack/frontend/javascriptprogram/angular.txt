Angular is the framework for building the single page client application using html and typescript.
framework is set of predefined code ,we can reuse the code.
Angular 1 developed by microsoft in 2011,angular 2(react js) facebook  in 2015,....upto angular 11.
Every year,2 latest version updates.

Js is the front end scripting language.
Node js is the backend scripting language.
first install the Node js and we will access the angular.

Node js version 14.16 LTS long time support
 current version -15 cannot be used.

why angular js:
SPA-single page application there is only one html file.
In SPA,when the user moves from one to tab to anoyher tab,the whole page is not reloaded.
Istead only a part of the html is replaces with another file.

Dynamically typed language.
